## Overview

All hands-on exercises in this workshop use **Google Colab**, a free cloud-based Python environment. This means:

- No software installation required
- Works on any computer with a web browser
- All packages are pre-installed
- Your work is automatically saved to Google Drive

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Google Account

You need a Google account to use Colab. If you don't have one:

1. Go to [accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com)
2. Click "Create account"
3. Follow the setup instructions

### Step 2: Access Google Colab

1. Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. You should see the Colab welcome screen

### Step 3: Test Your Setup

Click the button below to open the test notebook from our shared Google Drive:

[![Open Test Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Z9H4SpAsRT6HqCe1pT82WyX93xiKeBe5)

::: {.callout-tip}
All workshop notebooks are available in our [Shared Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Z9H4SpAsRT6HqCe1pT82WyX93xiKeBe5?usp=drive_link). Open any `.ipynb` file with Google Colab by right-clicking and selecting "Open with > Google Colaboratory".
:::

Run all cells to verify your environment is working.

## Workshop Notebooks

During the workshop, you'll access notebooks via badges like this:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com)

Each hands-on session page includes a Colab badge linking directly to that exercise.

## Saving Your Work

### Option 1: Save to Google Drive (Recommended)

1. Click **File > Save a copy in Drive**
2. Your copy is saved to "Colab Notebooks" in your Drive
3. You can rename and organize as needed

### Option 2: Download

1. Click **File > Download > Download .ipynb**
2. Save the file to your computer

## Colab Basics

### Running Code

- **Run a cell**: Click the play button or press `Shift+Enter`
- **Run all cells**: Click **Runtime > Run all**
- **Stop execution**: Click **Runtime > Interrupt execution**

### Adding Cells

- **Code cell**: Click `+ Code`
- **Text cell**: Click `+ Text`

### Runtime

Colab provides a free GPU/CPU runtime:

- Sessions disconnect after ~90 minutes of inactivity
- Maximum session length is ~12 hours
- Your code is saved, but runtime state is lost on disconnect

## Troubleshooting

### "Notebook not found"

- Check your internet connection
- Make sure you're signed into Google
- Try opening in a new incognito window

### "Runtime disconnected"

- This is normal after inactivity
- Click **Reconnect** to get a new runtime
- Re-run your code cells from the beginning

### Slow performance

- Check if you're using GPU: **Runtime > Change runtime type**
- For ML exercises, select **T4 GPU**

## Backup: Local Installation

If Google Colab is unavailable, you can run notebooks locally:

### Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sysylvia/ethiopia-ds-workshop-2026.git
cd ethiopia-ds-workshop-2026

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

### Required Packages

The main packages we'll use:

- `pandas` - Data manipulation
