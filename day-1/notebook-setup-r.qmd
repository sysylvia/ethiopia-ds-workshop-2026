## Learning Objectives

In this hands-on session, you will:

1. Set up a Google Colab notebook with R and tidymodels
2. Load and explore the workshop dataset using tidyverse
3. Create initial visualizations with ggplot2
4. See overfitting in action
5. Understand why train/test splits and cross-validation matter

## Prerequisites

- Google account with Colab access
- Completed [Computing Setup](../computing.qmd) guide
- Basic familiarity with R (helpful but not required)

## Key R Packages

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| tidymodels | ML framework (recipes, parsnip, rsample, tune) |
| tidyverse | Data manipulation and visualization |
| ggplot2 | Visualization |

## After This Session

You will have:

- A working R environment in Colab
- Familiarity with the workshop dataset
- Visual intuition for overfitting
- Understanding of why we need validation strategies
