## Overview

Day 1 establishes the foundation for the entire workshop. We'll cover fundamental concepts in data science, introduce reproducible research practices, and get everyone set up with the computing environment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 1, you will be able to:

- Distinguish between machine learning, statistics, and econometrics approaches
