## Overview

Day 1 establishes the foundation for the entire workshop. We'll cover fundamental concepts in data science, introduce machine learning principles, and get everyone set up with the computing environment—including a hands-on demonstration of overfitting.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 1, you will be able to:

- Distinguish between machine learning, statistics, and econometrics approaches
- Understand the difference between prediction and causal inference
- Explain the bias-variance tradeoff and why overfitting is dangerous
- Set up a Google Colab environment for Python-based analysis
- Visualize overfitting using a sine wave demonstration
- Understand the role of data science in health policy decisions

## Key Concepts

### ML Foundations (Afternoon)

The afternoon lecture introduces core machine learning concepts:

- **Supervised learning**: Learning patterns from labeled data
- **Prediction vs. causation**: When prediction is enough
- **Bias-variance tradeoff**: Understanding model complexity
- **Cross-validation**: Preventing overfitting
- **Preview of Day 2**: LASSO, Ridge, Trees


## Preparation

Before this session:

1. Complete the [Computing Setup](../computing.qmd) guide
