# Welcome!

## Data Sciences for Modeling & Health Technology Assessment

**WISE Project Training Workshop**

Addis Ababa University | February 2-7, 2026

---

# The WISE Project

## Gates Grand Challenges Award

Building local capacity in:

- **Data science** for health systems
- **Predictive modeling** for supply chains
- **Agent-based simulation** for policy analysis

---

## Ethiopia Context

- Pharmaceutical supply chain challenges
- Health workforce distribution
- Data-driven decision making
