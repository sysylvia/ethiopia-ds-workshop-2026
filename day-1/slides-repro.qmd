## Why Reproducibility Matters

- Science requires verification
- Your future self will thank you
- Collaboration becomes possible
- Errors are easier to find

---

## The Reproducibility Crisis

> "More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments."
>
> — Nature Survey, 2016

## What Makes Research Reproducible?

1. **Code** - All analysis steps documented
2. **Data** - Raw data preserved and accessible
3. **Environment** - Software versions recorded
4. **Documentation** - Clear explanations

## Project Structure

```
my-project/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/           # Never modify
│   └── processed/     # Derived data
├── notebooks/         # Analysis notebooks
├── src/               # Reusable code
├── outputs/           # Results, figures
├── README.md          # Project overview
└── requirements.txt   # Dependencies
```

## Version Control with Git

- Track changes over time
- Collaborate without conflicts
- Revert mistakes easily
- Document your reasoning

---

## Google Colab for Reproducibility

**Advantages:**

- Consistent environment
- Easy sharing
- No setup required
- Free compute resources

---

## Best Practices

1. **Never modify raw data**
2. **Document everything**
3. **Use relative paths**
4. **Record package versions**
5. **Write code for humans**
