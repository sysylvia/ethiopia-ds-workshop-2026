General Social Survey Experiment Dataset
========================================

This dataset comes from a randomized experiment within the General Social Survey (GSS) 
that tests how question wording affects responses about government spending on social programs.

Variables:
----------
- y: Outcome variable (1 = respondent thinks government spends too much, 0 = does not)
- w: Treatment variable (1 = asked about "welfare", 0 = asked about "assistance to the poor")
- age: Respondent's age in years
- polviews: Political views (1 = extremely liberal to 7 = extremely conservative)
- income: Income level (categorical)
- educ: Years of education
- marital: Marital status (categorical)
- sex: Sex (1 = male, 2 = female)

Experimental Design:
-------------------
This is a survey experiment where respondents were randomly assigned to receive one of two 
versions of a question about government spending. The treatment group was asked if the 
government spends too much on "welfare" while the control group was asked the same question 
but with the phrase "assistance to the poor" instead of "welfare."

This experiment demonstrates how framing effects can influence public opinion, as the term 
"welfare" often carries different connotations than "assistance to the poor" despite 
referring to similar programs.

Sample Size: ~14,000 observations

Usage in Workshop:
-----------------
This dataset is used in Day 5 of the workshop to demonstrate:
1. Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimation in randomized experiments
2. Creating selection bias in observational data
3. Implementing IPW, AIPW, and causal forest methods
4. Assessing covariate balance and overlap
