## Overview

Day 3 bridges machine learning and simulation modeling. We'll explore different modeling paradigms and learn how to use ML predictions as inputs to agent-based models.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 3, you will be able to:

- Distinguish between System Dynamics and Agent-Based modeling approaches
- Understand when to use each modeling paradigm
- Generate predictions from ML models for simulation inputs
- Design the interface between ML and ABM components

## Key Concepts

### System Dynamics vs Agent-Based Models

| Aspect | System Dynamics | Agent-Based |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Focus | Aggregate flows | Individual agents |
| Perspective | Top-down | Bottom-up |
| Data needs | Lower | Higher |
| Complexity | Simpler | More complex |

## The WISE Project Context

The WISE project aims to reduce wastage and shortages in Ethiopia's pharmaceutical supply chain. The modeling approach:

1. **ML Component**: Forecast demand at different levels
2. **ABM Component**: Simulate supply chain dynamics
3. **Integration**: Use forecasts to parameterize agent behaviors
4. **Policy**: Test interventions in silico

## Preparation

Before this session:

1. Complete Day 2 hands-on exercises
2. Have your trained ML model saved
3. Review [glossary](../resources/glossary.qmd) of simulation terms
