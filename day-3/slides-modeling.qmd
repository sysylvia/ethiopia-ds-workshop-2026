## Why Simulation?

- Test policies before implementation
- Understand complex system behavior
- Explore "what-if" scenarios
- Identify intervention leverage points

---

## Two Paradigms

1. **System Dynamics (SD)**: Focus on flows and stocks
2. **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)**: Focus on individual entities

---

## System Dynamics

Think of a river system:

- **Stocks**: Water levels at different points
- **Flows**: Movement between locations
- **Feedback**: How flows affect stocks

Good for understanding **aggregate behavior** and **bottlenecks**.

---

## Agent-Based Modeling

Think of individual water molecules:

- **Agents**: Individual entities with rules
- **Interactions**: How agents affect each other
- **Emergence**: System-level patterns from individual behavior

Good for understanding **heterogeneity** and **emergence**.

---

## Comparison

| Aspect | System Dynamics | Agent-Based |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Unit of analysis | Aggregate | Individual |
| Data requirements | Lower | Higher |
| Computational cost | Lower | Higher |
| Heterogeneity | Limited | Full |
| Emergence | Not captured | Captured |

---

## Supply Chain Example: SD

```
[Manufacturer] → Flow → [Warehouse] → Flow → [Facility]
                  ↑                     ↑
             Orders ←←←←←←←←←←←←←← Demand
```

Tracks **aggregate** quantities flowing through the system.

---

## Supply Chain Example: ABM

- Each facility is an **agent**
- Each medication lot is tracked
- Agents make decisions based on rules
- Can track specific medications, expiry dates

---

## Why ABM for WISE?

1. **Heterogeneity**: Facilities vary in size, location, capacity
2. **Tracking**: Need to follow specific medications
3. **Targeted interventions**: Different policies for different agents
4. **Emergence**: System-wide patterns from local decisions

---

## The Integration Challenge

How do we connect ML predictions to ABM?

- ML: "Demand will be X next month"
- ABM: Agent ordering behavior

**Bridge**: Use predictions to parameterize agent decision rules.

## Hands-on Preview

In the next session, we'll:

1. Generate predictions from our ML model
2. Format predictions for ABM input
3. Explore a simplified ABM
4. Connect the components
