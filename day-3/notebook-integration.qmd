## Learning Objectives

In this hands-on session, you will:

1. Load your trained ML model from Day 2
2. Generate demand predictions for future periods
3. Format predictions as ABM input parameters
4. Run a simplified supply chain simulation
5. Analyze simulation outputs

## Prerequisites

- Completed Day 2 notebooks (trained demand forecasting model)
- Understanding of modeling concepts from today's lecture

## Exercise Overview

### Part 1: Generate Predictions (20 min)

- Load the trained model
- Create feature data for future periods
- Generate demand forecasts
- Visualize predictions

### Part 2: Format for ABM (20 min)

- Structure predictions by facility and time
- Create agent parameter files
- Validate data format

### Part 3: Simple ABM Introduction (30 min)

- Understand the ABM structure
- Define agent behaviors
- Run baseline simulation
- Visualize supply chain dynamics

### Part 4: Integration (20 min)

- Connect ML predictions to ABM inputs
- Compare scenarios:
  - Static demand estimates
  - ML-based demand forecasts
- Analyze impact on wastage/shortages

## The Integration Pipeline

```python
# 1. Load trained model
import joblib
model = joblib.load('demand_model.pkl')

# 2. Generate predictions
future_features = create_future_features(start='2026-03', periods=12)
predictions = model.predict(future_features)

# 3. Format for ABM
agent_params = format_for_abm(predictions, facilities)

# 4. Run ABM with predictions
simulation = SupplyChainABM(agent_params)
results = simulation.run(steps=365)
```

## Key Concepts

### Agent Parameters

Each facility agent needs:

- **Expected demand**: ML predictions by month
- **Order policy**: When and how much to order
- **Capacity constraints**: Storage limits
- **Lead time expectations**: Delivery delays

### Connecting the Pieces

The ML model provides demand forecasts that inform:

1. **Order quantities**: How much to request
2. **Order timing**: When to place orders
3. **Buffer stock**: Safety margins based on forecast uncertainty

## After This Session

You will have:

- Experience with the ML-ABM integration workflow
- Understanding of how predictions parameterize simulations
- Foundation for Day 4's deeper ABM exploration
- Insight into the WISE project modeling approach
