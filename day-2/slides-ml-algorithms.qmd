## Algorithm Families Overview

1. **Linear Models**
2. **Tree-Based Methods**
3. **Ensemble Methods**
4. **Other Approaches**

---

## Linear Models

$$\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_p x_p$$

**Types:**

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression (L2 penalty)
- Lasso (L1 penalty)
- Elastic Net (L1 + L2)

---

## When to Use Linear Models

**Advantages:**

- Interpretable coefficients
- Fast training
- Works well with many features
- Good baseline

**Limitations:**

- Assumes linear relationships
- Sensitive to outliers
- May underfit complex patterns

---

## Decision Trees

Split data recursively based on feature thresholds.

```
        [Feature X < 5?]
           /        \
        Yes          No
         |            |
    [Feature Y < 3?]  Predict: A
       /      \
     Yes       No
      |         |
  Predict: B  Predict: C
```

## Tree Advantages & Limitations

**Advantages:**

- Easy to interpret
- Handles non-linear relationships
- No feature scaling needed
- Captures interactions automatically

**Limitations:**

- Prone to overfitting
- Unstable (small data changes → different tree)
- May not generalize well

---

## Random Forest

**Idea**: Combine many trees to reduce variance.

1. Create many bootstrap samples
2. Train a tree on each sample
3. Use random subset of features at each split
4. Average predictions (regression) or vote (classification)

---

## Gradient Boosting

**Idea**: Build trees sequentially, each correcting previous errors.

1. Train initial model
2. Compute residuals (errors)
3. Train new tree to predict residuals
4. Add to ensemble (with learning rate)
5. Repeat

**Popular implementations**: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost

## Ensemble Comparison

| Method | Trees | Training | Overfitting Risk |
|--------|-------|----------|------------------|
| Random Forest | Parallel | Fast | Lower |
| Gradient Boosting | Sequential | Slower | Higher |

Both typically outperform single trees.

---

## Choosing an Algorithm

| Data Characteristics | Recommended |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Linear relationships | Linear models |
| Non-linear, interactions | Tree-based |
| High dimensionality | Lasso, Ridge |
| Large dataset | Gradient Boosting |
| Need interpretability | Linear, Single Tree |
| Best accuracy | Ensemble methods |

---

## Today's Approach

1. Start with a **baseline** (linear model)
2. Try **Random Forest**
3. Try **Gradient Boosting**
4. Compare using cross-validation
5. Tune the best performer
