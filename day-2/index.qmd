title: "Day 2: ML Algorithms & Practice"
subtitle: "Tuesday, February 3, 2026"

## Overview

Day 2 is dedicated to **machine learning algorithms for supply chain forecasting**. We use an alternating lecture → hands-on pattern so you can immediately apply each concept.

Building on the ML foundations from Day 1, you'll learn regularization techniques (LASSO, Ridge) and tree-based methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting). These ML models generate the **demand forecasts** that feed into the agent-based simulation models covered on Days 3-4.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 2, you will be able to:

1. **Implement** regularized regression models (LASSO, Ridge, Elastic Net)
2. **Explain** how LASSO performs automatic feature selection
3. **Build** decision trees and understand their splitting logic
4. **Compare** Random Forest vs Gradient Boosting approaches
5. **Apply** cross-validation to select optimal model complexity
6. **Evaluate** model performance using appropriate metrics
7. **Connect** ML predictions to supply chain simulation inputs

## Day Structure: Alternating Pattern

```
Morning:   Lecture (LASSO)  →  Hands-on (LASSO)
                 │                    │
                 └──── Apply immediately ────┘

Afternoon: Lecture (Trees)  →  Hands-on (Forecasting)
                 │                    │
                 └──── Full ML pipeline ────┘
```

This alternating approach ensures you:
- Apply each concept immediately after learning it
- Build intuition through hands-on practice
- Complete a full ML pipeline by end of day

## Key Concepts

### Morning: Regularization

Why add penalties to linear models?

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Many features (high-dimensional) | LASSO shrinks & selects |
| Correlated features | Ridge shrinks all |
| Unknown which is best | Elastic Net combines both |
| Choosing penalty strength | Cross-validation |

### Afternoon: Tree-Based Methods

Non-linear methods that capture complex patterns:

| Method | How it works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Decision Tree** | Recursive splitting, easy to interpret |
| **Random Forest** | Many trees averaged, reduces variance |
| **Gradient Boosting** | Trees that learn from mistakes |

### Algorithm Selection Guide

| Data Characteristics | Recommended Approach |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Linear relationships | Linear models (LASSO, Ridge) |
| Non-linear patterns | Tree-based methods |
| High dimensionality (many features) | LASSO, Elastic Net |
| Need interpretability | Linear models, single decision trees |
| Maximum accuracy | Ensemble methods (RF, Gradient Boosting) |

## Connection to Days 3-4

```
Day 2: ML Demand Forecasts  →  Day 3-4: ABM Supply Chain Simulation
    (What will demand be?)        (How will the system respond?)
```

Your ML predictions become **inputs** to the agent-based models, answering:
- How much medication will each facility need?
- Which facilities are at risk of stockout?
- What should reorder quantities be?

## Pre-Session Preparation

Before this session, ensure you:

1. ✅ Completed Day 1 hands-on exercises (including sine wave demo)
2. ✅ Can access Google Colab ([test here](../computing.qmd))
3. ✅ Review the [glossary](../resources/glossary.qmd) of ML terms
