## Overview

Day 2 is dedicated to machine learning fundamentals. We'll cover the complete ML pipeline from data preparation through model evaluation, with hands-on exercises using supply chain data.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 2, you will be able to:

- Explain the difference between prediction and causal inference
- Implement a complete ML pipeline (train/validate/test)
- Choose appropriate algorithms for different problem types
- Evaluate model performance using proper metrics
- Tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting

## Key Concepts

### The ML Pipeline

```
Raw Data → Preprocessing → Feature Engineering → Train/Val/Test Split
    → Model Training → Evaluation → Iteration → Final Model
```

### Algorithm Families

1. **Linear Models**: Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net
2. **Tree-Based**: Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
3. **Other**: k-NN, Support Vector Machines

## Preparation

Before this session, ensure you:

1. Completed Day 1 hands-on exercise
2. Can access Google Colab
3. Review the [glossary](../resources/glossary.qmd) of ML terms
