Day 2 materials will be available on February 3, 2026.

## Overview

Day 2 is dedicated to **machine learning fundamentals for supply chain forecasting**. We'll cover the complete ML pipeline from data preparation through model evaluation, with hands-on exercises using pharmaceutical supply chain data.

Building on the reproducible research practices from Day 1, you'll learn how ML models can generate the **demand forecasts** that feed into the agent-based simulation models covered on Days 3-4.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 2, you will be able to:

1. **Distinguish** between prediction and causal inference tasks in health policy
2. **Apply** the bias-variance tradeoff to select appropriate model complexity
3. **Implement** cross-validation for robust model evaluation
4. **Build** regularized regression models (LASSO, Ridge) for high-dimensional data
5. **Construct** and interpret tree-based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
6. **Evaluate** when to use ML versus traditional statistical methods
7. **Connect** ML methods to real-world supply chain applications

## Key Concepts

### The ML Workflow

```
1. Define the problem        ──▶ What are we predicting? Why?
2. Collect and prepare data  ──▶ Features, outcomes, cleaning
3. Feature engineering       ──▶ Create informative inputs
4. Train candidate models    ──▶ Linear, trees, ensembles...
5. Evaluate and compare      ──▶ Cross-validation metrics
6. Tune best model           ──▶ Hyperparameter optimization
7. Final evaluation          ──▶ Test set performance
8. Deploy and monitor        ──▶ Use predictions → ABM inputs
```

### Algorithm Selection Guide

| Data Characteristics | Recommended Approach |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Linear relationships | Linear models (LASSO, Ridge) |
| Non-linear patterns | Tree-based methods |
| High dimensionality (many features) | LASSO, Elastic Net |
| Need interpretability | Linear models, single decision trees |
| Maximum accuracy | Ensemble methods (RF, Gradient Boosting) |

### Connection to Days 3-4

ML predictions → **Day 3**: Feed into agent-based models as demand inputs

```
Day 2: ML Demand Forecasts  →  Day 3-4: ABM Supply Chain Simulation
    (What will demand be?)        (How will the system respond?)
```
