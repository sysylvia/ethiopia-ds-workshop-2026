## What is Machine Learning?

> "Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."
>
> — Arthur Samuel, 1959

## ML vs Statistics vs Econometrics

| Approach | Goal | Focus |
|----------|------|-------|
| Statistics | Inference | Uncertainty quantification |
| Econometrics | Causation | Identification strategies |
| Machine Learning | Prediction | Out-of-sample performance |

---

## Prediction vs Causation

**Prediction**: What will Y be given X?

- Weather forecasting
- Disease risk prediction
- Demand forecasting

**Causation**: Does X cause Y?

- Treatment effects
- Policy evaluation
- Impact assessment

## The Fundamental Tradeoff

```
                    ↑ Model Complexity
                    |
    Underfitting    |    Overfitting
    (High Bias)     |    (High Variance)
                    |
    ←───────────────┼───────────────→
       Training     │    Test
       Performance  │    Performance
```

## Train / Validate / Test

1. **Training set** (60-70%): Learn patterns
2. **Validation set** (15-20%): Tune hyperparameters
3. **Test set** (15-20%): Final evaluation

**Golden Rule**: Never touch test set until the end!

## Cross-Validation

```
Fold 1: [TRAIN] [TRAIN] [TRAIN] [TRAIN] [VAL]
Fold 2: [TRAIN] [TRAIN] [TRAIN] [VAL] [TRAIN]
Fold 3: [TRAIN] [TRAIN] [VAL] [TRAIN] [TRAIN]
Fold 4: [TRAIN] [VAL] [TRAIN] [TRAIN] [TRAIN]
Fold 5: [VAL] [TRAIN] [TRAIN] [TRAIN] [TRAIN]
```

More robust than a single split.

## Evaluation Metrics: Regression

- **MSE**: Mean Squared Error
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error
- **R²**: Coefficient of determination

---

## Evaluation Metrics: Classification

- **Accuracy**: Overall correct predictions
- **Precision**: True positives / Predicted positives
- **Recall**: True positives / Actual positives
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **AUC-ROC**: Area under ROC curve

---

## The ML Workflow

```
1. Define the problem
2. Collect and prepare data
3. Feature engineering
4. Train candidate models
5. Evaluate and compare
6. Tune best model
7. Final evaluation on test set
8. Deploy and monitor
```
