## Learning Objectives

In this hands-on session, you will:

1. Load and preprocess supply chain data
2. Engineer features for demand prediction
3. Train multiple ML models
4. Evaluate and compare model performance

## The Problem

You are a data scientist working with the Ethiopian pharmaceutical supply chain. Your task is to build a model that predicts **demand** for essential medications based on:

- Historical consumption data
- Facility characteristics
- Seasonal patterns
- Regional factors

## Exercise Overview

### Part 1: Data Preparation (20 min)

- Load the supply chain dataset
- Handle missing values
- Create train/test split

### Part 2: Feature Engineering (20 min)

- Create time-based features (month, quarter, year)
- Encode categorical variables
- Scale numerical features

### Part 3: Model Training (30 min)

- Train a linear regression baseline
- Train a Random Forest model
- Train a Gradient Boosting model
- Compare performance

### Part 4: Interpretation (20 min)

- Examine feature importance
- Analyze prediction errors
- Discuss implications for supply chain

## Key Code Snippets

### Train/Test Split

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
```

### Train a Model

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Evaluate

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions, squared=False)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"RMSE: {rmse:.2f}, R²: {r2:.3f}")
```

## After This Session

You will have:

- Built and evaluated multiple ML models
- Understanding of the full ML pipeline
- A baseline model for demand forecasting
- Readiness for model tuning in the next session
