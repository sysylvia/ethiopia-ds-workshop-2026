## Machine Learning Terms

**Algorithm**
: A set of rules or instructions for solving a problem or making predictions.

**Cross-validation**
: A technique for evaluating model performance by training and testing on different subsets of data.

**Feature**
: An input variable used to make predictions (also called predictor or independent variable).

**Feature Engineering**
: The process of creating new features from raw data to improve model performance.

**Gradient Boosting**
: An ensemble method that builds trees sequentially, with each tree correcting errors from previous ones.

**Hyperparameter**
: A setting that controls the learning process (e.g., number of trees, learning rate).

**Overfitting**
: When a model learns the training data too well, including noise, and performs poorly on new data.

**Random Forest**
: An ensemble method that combines many decision trees trained on random subsets of data.

**Regularization**
: Techniques to prevent overfitting by penalizing model complexity (e.g., L1/Lasso, L2/Ridge).

**Target**
: The output variable being predicted (also called dependent variable or label).

**Train/Test Split**
: Dividing data into separate sets for training and evaluating the model.

**Underfitting**
: When a model is too simple to capture patterns in the data.

## Modeling & Simulation Terms

**Agent**
: An autonomous entity in a simulation that follows rules and interacts with its environment.

**Agent-Based Model (ABM)**
: A simulation approach where system behavior emerges from individual agent interactions.

**Deterministic Model**
: A model that produces the same output given the same inputs (no randomness).

**Emergence**
: Complex system-level patterns arising from simple individual-level rules.

**Monte Carlo Simulation**
: Using random sampling to understand system behavior and uncertainty.

**Stochastic Model**
: A model that includes random elements, producing different outputs each run.

**System Dynamics (SD)**
: A modeling approach focusing on feedback loops and flows between system components.

## Supply Chain Terms

**Buffer Stock**
: Extra inventory held to protect against uncertainty (also called safety stock).

**Lead Time**
: The time between placing an order and receiving the goods.

**Stockout**
: When inventory reaches zero and demand cannot be met.

**Wastage**
: Loss of products due to expiration, damage, or other factors.

**Reorder Point**
: The inventory level at which a new order should be placed.

**Service Level**
: The probability of meeting demand without a stockout.

## Data Science Terms

**Categorical Variable**
: A variable with discrete categories (e.g., region, facility type).

**Data Wrangling**
: The process of cleaning and transforming raw data for analysis.

**Encoding**
: Converting categorical variables to numerical format for modeling.

**Imputation**
: Filling in missing values using statistical methods.

**Normalization/Scaling**
: Transforming variables to a common scale.

**Outlier**
: An observation that differs significantly from other observations.

## Python/Programming Terms

**DataFrame**
: A two-dimensional data structure in pandas (like a spreadsheet).

**Function**
: A reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

**Library/Package**
: A collection of pre-written code for specific tasks (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn).

**Loop**
: Code that repeats a set of instructions multiple times.

**Variable**
: A named storage location for data in a program.
