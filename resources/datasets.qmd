## Supply Chain Dataset

The primary dataset for hands-on exercises simulates pharmaceutical supply chain data across Ethiopia's health facilities.

### Description

| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `facility_id` | string | Unique facility identifier (F001-F020) |
| `facility_name` | string | Facility name |
| `facility_type` | categorical | Hospital, Health Center, or Clinic |
| `region` | string | Geographic region (5 regions) |
| `population_served` | numeric | Population catchment area |
| `month` | numeric | Month of observation (1-12) |
| `year` | numeric | Year of observation |
| `previous_demand` | numeric | Demand in the previous month |
| `distance_to_warehouse` | numeric | Distance to regional warehouse (km) |
| `season` | categorical | Dry or Rainy season |
| `stockout_last_month` | binary | 1 if stockout occurred last month |
| `avg_delivery_days` | numeric | Average delivery time (days) |
| `storage_capacity` | numeric | Maximum storage capacity (units) |
| `actual_demand` | numeric | Actual demand for the month (target variable) |

### Regional Coverage

| Region | Facilities | Facility Types |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Addis Ababa | 4 | 2 Hospitals, 2 Health Centers |
| Oromia | 4 | 2 Hospitals, 1 Health Center, 1 Clinic |
| Amhara | 4 | 2 Hospitals, 1 Health Center, 1 Clinic |
| SNNP | 4 | 2 Hospitals, 1 Health Center, 1 Clinic |
| Tigray | 4 | 2 Hospitals, 1 Health Center, 1 Clinic |

### Loading the Data

In Google Colab:

```python
import pandas as pd

# From GitHub (recommended)
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sysylvia/ethiopia-ds-workshop-2026/main/data/supply-chain-sample.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

print(f"Loaded {len(df)} records from {df['facility_id'].nunique()} facilities")
```

### Data Characteristics

- **Time range**: January - December 2024 (12 months)
- **Facilities**: 20 facilities across 5 regions
- **Observations**: 240 rows (20 facilities × 12 months)
- **Target variable**: `actual_demand` (units of medication)

### Key Patterns in the Data

1. **Seasonal effects**: Demand decreases during rainy season (months 5-8)
2. **Facility type effects**: Hospitals have higher demand than clinics
3. **Regional variation**: Distance to warehouse affects delivery times
4. **Temporal autocorrelation**: Previous demand predicts current demand

### Sample Data Preview

```python
df[['facility_name', 'region', 'month', 'previous_demand', 'actual_demand']].head(10)
```

| facility_name | region | month | previous_demand | actual_demand |
|---------------|--------|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| Yekatit 12 Hospital | Addis Ababa | 1 | 180 | 195 |
| Yekatit 12 Hospital | Addis Ababa | 2 | 195 | 188 |
| Yekatit 12 Hospital | Addis Ababa | 3 | 188 | 201 |

## Data Quality Notes

- This is **synthetic data** created for educational purposes
- Patterns are inspired by real-world Ethiopian supply chain dynamics
- The data includes realistic features like:
  - Seasonal demand patterns
  - Facility-type effects
  - Stockout events
  - Regional infrastructure differences
- No actual health data or PHI is included

## Relationship to ABM

The ML predictions from this dataset feed into the agent-based model:

- **Facility agents** use `expected_demand` to determine order quantities
- **Warehouse agents** manage regional stock based on aggregate forecasts
- **Uncertainty estimates** from ML models inform safety stock levels

## Additional Datasets

Additional datasets may be shared via Google Drive during the workshop:

- ABM parameter files
- Historical consumption patterns
- Regional infrastructure characteristics
